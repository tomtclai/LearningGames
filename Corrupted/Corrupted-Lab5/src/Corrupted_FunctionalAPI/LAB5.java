/**
 * LAB 5: If/Else: Personalization
 * 
 * This is an example of a "Treasure Map" game, though students should be encouraged to make whatever
 * game they like with the skills they have.
 * 
 * Note:  To allow students to personalize the tiles, have them replace the pngs in the resource folder.
 *        They will need to replace: red.png, green.png, yellow.png, blue.png, light_blue.png, purple.png.
 *        The size of these pictures in the game is 72 x 72 pixels
